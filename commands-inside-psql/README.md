# Commands Inside PSQL

`psql` console is where you can access and query databases. Before you query tables you'd need to know how to conect to a certain database, how to list them and more.

Here are some commands:

- List databases: `\l`
- Describe table: `\d+ [tablename]`
- List roles: `\du`
- Connect to database: `\c [databasename]`
- List tables in [database]: `\dt`
- List columns in [tablename]: `\d [tablename]`
- Describe table: `\d+`
