# PSQL Cheat Sheet

List of commands for managing and using PostgreSQL.

psql commands are quite forgetable and I forget them a lot, that is why I decided to arrange them into a cheat sheet for easy referencing.

## Contents

This cheat sheet is divided into four main sections:

- [Queries](queries/)
- [Commands Inside PSQL]()
- [Commands Outside PSQL]()
- [Utilities]()
