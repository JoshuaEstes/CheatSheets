# PSQL Cheat Sheet

List of commands for managing and using PostgreSQL.

`psql` commands are quite forgettable and I forget them a lot, that is why I decided to arrange them into a cheat sheet for easy referencing.

## Contents

This cheat sheet is divided into four main sections:

- [Queries](queries/)
- [Commands Inside PSQL](commands-inside-psql/)
- [Commands Outside PSQL](commands-outside-psql/)
- [Utilities](utilities/)
